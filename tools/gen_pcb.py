# Parts are *packed* inside their strip (row by row, no overlaps by
# construction) rather than hand-placed, so the same script keeps working when
# the part list changes.  The socket block is not packed -- see XIAO below.
#
# A strip is (x0, y0, x1): packing starts at y0 and wraps to a new row once it
# would cross x1.  Rows run downwards until the part list is exhausted, so the
# board height is sized around the packed result (see BOARD_H) instead of the
# packing being fenced in by a height chosen first.
#
# Packing starts at y = 9 rather than y = 6: the four mounting holes sit 5 mm in
# from the top corners and their courtyards reach 3.45 mm back (see MOUNTING
# below), so the first row has to clear them.  Placement never collides with a

# The socket pair's job is to mate with a Seeed XIAO, so its geometry is the

# headers is what produced the bug this table replaces: the packer put them
# 6.1 mm apart (two footprint widths plus MARGIN), ERC was clean, DRC was
# clean, all 11 nets routed -- and the module could not physically seat.  Mating
# geometry is invisible to both checkers: every footprint is valid on its own,
# the nets are right, and nothing looks at the *pair*.  So it is stated here
# once and asserted on the finished board in check_board.py.
#
# Numbers from Seeed's own KiCad footprint for the module's DIP variant
# (github.com/Seeed-Studio/OPL_Kicad_Library, "Seeed Studio XIAO Series
# Library/XIAO-ESP32-C3-DIP.kicad_mod"): the mating part's own geometry, which
# beats a number read off a drawing, and it is where the 15.24 mm comes from
# rather than from an estimate.

# GND, 3V3, D10, D9, D8, D7.  D0 and VBUS are the pins *nearest the USB-C
# end*; the antenna is at the far end.  On this board the module stands with
# its rows vertical and its USB-C end towards the top edge (y = 0):
#
#   J1 = the module's left column  (D0..D6), pad column at x = row1_x
#   J2 = the module's right column (5V, GND, 3V3, D10, D9, D8, D7), one
#        row_sep to its right
#   pin 1 of BOTH rows is at the top (y = pin1_y), i.e. at the USB-C end.
#
# That is the way round the schematic already reads: J1.2 = D1 (GPIO3, the SSR
# trigger) is the second pin down from the USB-C end, and J2.1/J2.2 = 5V/GND
# are the first two of the right column.  Rotate either row by 180 deg and the
# board fires the wrong pin -- silently, because the nets are still correct.
