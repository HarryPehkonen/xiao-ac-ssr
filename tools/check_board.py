"""Gate: the saved board passes DRC and honours the rules DRC cannot state.

    python3 tools/check_board.py        # exit 0 = clean

Two halves:

1. `kicad-cli pcb drc` on the committed board -- shorts, clearance, the 3 mm
   mains barrier rule, hole-to-hole, silk overlap.
2. Plain geometry on the same board, for what DRC has no rule for: every
   footprint id must name its library, the four M3 mounting holes must be
   where and what the design says, with the copper keepout actually empty, and
   the XIAO socket pair must be the shape that accepts the module -- 14 holes,
   two rows of 7, 2.54 mm pitch, the module's own 15.24 mm row separation, pin
   1 at the USB-C end, and the module's body clear of everything else.

The socket rules exist because of the bug this board shipped with: every
footprint on it was individually valid, the netlist was right, all 11 nets
routed and DRC was clean -- and the module could not physically seat, because
nothing compared the *pair* to the module it has to accept.  Mating-interface
geometry is invisible to ERC and DRC; assertion is the only defence.

The board is read from disk, not regenerated, so this gates what would be
fabricated.
