# Gate for this repo.  Six checks, all machine-verifiable:
#   1. the committed schematic -- and the symbol library it draws J1/J2 from --
#      is exactly what the generator produces
#   2. the netlist exported from it equals the intended netlist, and every pin
#      of the two XIAO socket rows carries the *module's* pin name
#      (see "The socket symbol" in docs/PCB-NOTES.md)
#   3. ERC reports no violations
#   4. the board passes DRC with no violations, and honours the rules DRC has
#      no rule for (every footprint id names its library, the mounting holes
#      are where the design says with an empty copper keepout, and the two
#      socket rows are one mating interface that a XIAO actually fits)
#   5. the committed board is the one the generator produces (placement + copper)
#   6. the rules in 2 and 4 have been seen to fail -- each is broken in
#      tools/tests/ and check_board.py or check_netlist.py must report it
# Run from anywhere:  ./tools/ci.sh
