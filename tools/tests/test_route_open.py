"""Regression: opening a pad near the board edge must not run off the grid.

`_open()` walks a pad's opening box and its escape spoke in cell coordinates
and asks the grid about every cell it lands on.  `Grid.unblock()` and
`Grid.block()` both ignore a cell that is not on the grid, but `Grid.is_blocked()`
did not: it indexed the bytearray with whatever cell it was handed.  A pad
within the opening's reach of an edge therefore made the walk read past the end
of the grid -- an `IndexError` out of the router, where the contract is the
router's own `no path <ref>.<pad> -> <ref>.<pad> [diagnosis]`.

Copied from the dimmer, where the same guard was missing: the fix is in
`tools/route.py`, which this repo shares with it.

Red before the fix: every test below either raises IndexError or reads a wrong
(off-grid) cell.
